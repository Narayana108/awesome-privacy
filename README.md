# Things to avoid
- All services and products from big monopolies like these:
  - Apple
  - Microsoft
  - Google, Youtube, Gmail, etc
  - Facebook & Whatsapp
  - Amazon
  - etc..
> There business practices/ethics/values promote the expoitation of users and
> create a society you don't want to live in.
> There are great alternatives for 80% of things, its basically 
> just open source hardware and people willing to do the right thing that is lacking
 
# Things to do
> Use software created by the people for the people.
> Lets protect our freedom of speech and privacy rights
- Promote and use open source technologies
- Promote and use privacy first software

## Email
>Email is not secure ! Avoid email if possible. If it cant be avoided use
>OpenPGP to encrypt your emails, but even OpenPGP is still vulnarable to some hacks. 
>The follow can also help prevent some hacks: 
>1. Be careful with attachments 
>2. Disable HTML
>3. decrypt and encypt emails outside of the mailclient 
>4. Don't cite text in reply
>5. Use mutt or neomutt email client

>I would recommend
>posteo.de or mailbox.org (1 Euro / month).
>Never take an American, Australian, Canadian, British or New Zealandish provider.
>European online privacy laws are the best at the moment. The Netherlands are
>doing a good job in enforcing them. Germany isn't bad either. But the whole
>climate in Europe is changing. Law enforcement agencies in  Europe want direct
>access to e-mail providers; we are not there yet.
>Create an alias or temporary alias for every website (like takealot.co.za) you
>create a new account. I know, this is cumbersome, but there is no other way
>around.

- [Mega](https://mega.nz/) - Not highly recommended but still better than Dropbox,googledrive,onedrive, etc.


# VPN
>You want to use a VPN, always!
>And also as always, you can not trust VPN providers, but I trust Internet service
>provicers (ISPs), like Vodacom, MTN, Telkom, etc, even less.
>But back to "always". If your VPN is offline all of your traffic should not make
>it through. There are ways of doing this. I mainly use SOCKS5 proxies.
>It works like this. If your VPN is online it also provides a SOCKS5 proxy on a
>port on your machine. You can now redirect your browsers traffic (for instance
>with the addon switchyOmega) through that proxy. If the VPN dies, your browser 
>won't be able to send requests. You want this for your whole system and all 
>applications. Read about this or ask me.

>I really like mullvad.net. Mainly for 3 reasons: a) I can pay in cash b) besides
>openVPN they offer wireguard (this deserves a whole section) c) really good support

>Don't trust free services.

>If you can, use Tor instead of a VPN, its much more secure and private, tho it
>is slower

  tmpfs	/home/<your user name>/.cache	tmpfs	noatime,nodev,nosuid,size=1G
  # mount the tmpfs sudo mount -a
