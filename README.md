## Email
>Use GPG mail if you know how.
>One cannot trust e-mail providers, especially gmail, yahoo, msn, outlook.com,
>apple.com, <free service that belongs to a company>.com
>Here are a few alternatives. Some don't cost anything, but I would recommend
>posteo.de or mailbox.org (1 Euro / month).
>Never take an American, Australian, Canadian, British or New Zealandish provider.
>European online privacy laws are the best at the moment. The Netherlands are
>doing a good job in enforcing them. Germany isn't bad either. But the whole
>climate in Europe is changing. Law enforcement agencies in  Europe want direct
>access to e-mail providers; we are not there yet. Again, don't use e-mail when
>you can avoid it.
>Create an alias or temporary alias for every website (like takealot.co.za) you
>create a new account. I know, this is cumbersome, but there is no other way
>around.

# VPN
>You want to use a VPN, always!
>And also as always, you can not trust VPN providers, but I trust Internet service
>provicers (ISPs), like Vodacom, MTN, Telkom, ..., even less.
>But back to "always". If your VPN is offline all of your traffic should not make
>it through. There are ways of doing this. I mainly use SOCKS5 proxies.
>It works like this. If your VPN is online it also provides a SOCKS5 proxy on a
>port on your machine. You can now redirect your browsers traffic (for instance
>with the addon switchyOmega) through that proxy. If the VPN dies, your browser 
>won't be able to send requests. You want this for your whole system and all 
>applications. Read about this or ask me.

>I really like mullvad.net. Mainly for 3 reasons: a) I can pay in cash b) besides
>openVPN they offer wireguard (this deserves a whole section) c) really good support

>Don't trust free services.
>If you can use tor instead of a vpn, its much more secure and private, tho it
>is slower

deletes itself at reboot.
```
## Delete your cache
rm -r $HOME/.cache/*
# put this in your /etc/fstab (change <your user name>)
tmpfs	/home/<your user name>/.cache	tmpfs	noatime,nodev,nosuid,size=1G
# mount the tmpfs
sudo mount -a
```
