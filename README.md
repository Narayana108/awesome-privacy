## Email
>Use GPG mail if you know how.
>E-Mail is a broken protocol and should not be used when ever possible. You
>cannot trust e-mail providers, especially gmail, yahoo, msn, outlook.com,
>apple.com, <free service that belongs to a company>.com
>Here are a few alternatives. Some don't cost anything, but I would recommend
>posteo.de or mailbox.org (1 Euro / month).
>Never take an American, Australian, Canadian, British or New Zealandish provider.
>European online privacy laws are the best at the moment. The Netherlands are
>doing a good job in enforcing them. Germany isn't bad either. But the whole
>climate in Europe is changing. Law enforcement agencies in  Europe want direct
>access to e-mail providers; we are not there yet. Again, don't use e-mail when
>you can avoid it.
>Create an alias or temporary alias for every website (like takealot.co.za) you
>create a new account. I know, this is cumbersome, but there is no other way
>around.

> Be careful with addons. You cannot trust them but you also cannot use a browser without them. (Maybe the Tor browser)
- [Browser privacy checker](https://panopticlick.eff.org/)
- [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) Privacy Badger blocks spying ads and invisible trackers.
- [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) HTTPS Everywhere is a Firefox, Chrome, and Opera extension that encrypts your communications with many major websites, making your browsing more secure.

- [SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/) - Highly recommended
- [Mega](https://mega.nz/) - Not highly recommended but still better that
  Dropbox,googledrive,onedrive, etc.


# VPN
>You want to use a VPN, always!
>And also as always, you can not trust VPN providers, but I trust Internet service
>provicers (ISPs), like Vodacom, MTN, Telkom, ..., even less.
>But back to "always". If your VPN is offline all of your traffic should not make
>it through. There are ways of doing this. I mainly use SOCKS5 proxies.
>It works like this. If your VPN is online it also provides a SOCKS5 proxy on a
>port on your machine. You can now redirect your browsers traffic (for instance
>with the addon switchyOmega) through that proxy. If the VPN dies, your browser 
>won't be able to send requests. You want this for your whole system and all 
>applications. Read about this or ask me.

>I really like mullvad.net. Mainly for 3 reasons: a) I can pay in cash b) besides
>openVPN they offer wireguard (this deserves a whole section) c) really good support

>Don't trust free services.

## OS
- [TailsOS](https://tails.boum.org/)

## Phone OS

# System
- You want your cache to be a tmpfs which means it lives in RAM -> faster and
deletes itself at reboot.
```
## Delete your cache
rm -r $HOME/.cache/*
# put this in your /etc/fstab (change <your user name>)
tmpfs	/home/<your user name>/.cache	tmpfs	noatime,nodev,nosuid,size=1G
# mount the tmpfs
sudo mount -a
```
